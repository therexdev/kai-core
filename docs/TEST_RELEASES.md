# Test first, then live

Install **Koinos AI Test** from [the test download page](https://github.com/therexdev/kaiapp/releases/tag/test-build). Windows has a separate Setup installer and portable executable. Linux has x64 and arm64 AppImages. The existing [live download](https://github.com/therexdev/kaiapp/releases/latest) stays on the stable release. This workflow currently builds Test for Windows and Linux.

## Switching your existing node to Test

1. Choose **Quit Koinos AI** from the running app's tray menu. Closing the window can leave it running. Quit an older Test build too if one is open.
2. Install the latest **Koinos AI Test** Setup and open Test. The main app can stay installed; Test has its own shortcut and update channel.
3. Test opens your existing chats, settings, wallet, models and node configuration. It retains the configured node-data location and connects to the same live network. If the saved wallet session is available and earning was enabled, the existing startup flow resumes it. Otherwise unlock the existing wallet and check earning in the app.

Live and Test share Electron's profile lock: only one can run at a time. Test keeps the live runtime name so OS-encrypted credentials use the same identity. Trying to open Test while Live is running shows switching instructions. To switch back, quit Test through the tray, then open Live. Desktop defaults to `%APPDATA%\\Koinos AI\\core` on Windows and the corresponding Electron app-data directory on other platforms. There is no profile migration or new node database.

Before each Test version first opens the shared profile, it saves configuration and encrypted wallet/session files in `core/test-profile-backups/<version>/`. Models, chats and blockchain databases remain in place and are not duplicated. A backup failure stops Test before Core opens. These are configuration restore points, not full data backups, and they are never restored automatically over evolving live state. Development builds use the source package version for this restore point.

The first two Test builds used a separate `Koinos AI Test` profile. New builds use the existing **Koinos AI** profile; they do not merge or delete data created in those older Test builds. Test continues contributing to the existing chain and scheduler using your saved settings. Switching requires an app restart; actual earnings and node health still need checking on your computer. Other users stay on the live installer and feed.

Developer environment variables can explicitly override data and ports. Headless mode retains its original home-directory profile and has no Electron lock: do not launch a second headless process against an active profile. Test does not install a competing `koinos-code` command.

## Working here

Use `test` as the working branch. `npm start` opens the test app from source; `npm run core:test` serves its UI headlessly. `npm run start:live` retains the original source launch when deliberately needed. `npm test` runs the suite.

Every push to `test` runs tests, then packages Windows and both Linux architectures. The ARM64 installer is built and exercised on a native ARM64 runner; the exact verified AppImage and feed join the release artifacts. Native OS credential/restart checks and wallet/provider integration gate publication. CI stamps the next patch version with `-test.<run-number>.<attempt>`, assigns Test's installer identity and generic updater feed, and verifies those settings inside the actual packaged ASAR. Windows also tests separate Live/Test native executables: each must block the other from opening the shared profile, and Test must decrypt an OS-encrypted credential saved by Live. Windows requires the existing Azure signing configuration and a successful signature verification gate. Publication waits for both platforms, uploads versioned binaries first and update feeds last, and retains older binaries so ongoing downloads can finish. Checksums and a versioned build JSON record the exact source SHA and workflow run.

New build payloads live in their own `test-build-<version>` prerelease, pinned to the verified source commit. This prevents further growth of the rolling release at GitHub's asset limit without removing any earlier download URLs. The rolling `test-build` page links to the current installer and artifact release; its existing `test*.yml` filenames remain the app's fixed update channel and use sibling paths to the new payloads. A complete public artifact release must exist before those channel pointers change. Original platform feeds remain beside their verification reports, while the relocated rolling feeds preserve the installer hashes.

The `test-build` tag is a rolling download channel, not a version/source attestation. Both it and each per-build artifact release stay marked prerelease and are never GitHub's latest stable release. Keep these tags non-semver: old live updaters accept prereleases and derive a channel from semver tags. A legacy Live updater may see any new artifact release first, so every artifact release contains stable `latest*.yml` compatibility manifests before it becomes public. These retain the latest live version, hashes and sibling paths to the original live assets. Test requests `test*.yml` through its unchanged fixed generic feed. New live builds also set `allowPrerelease=false`.

## Promoting ready work

The owner authorized normal pushes and ready releases. Check the exact test commit has a successful **Test installers** run, review the change, and promote it with a fresh stable version:

```bash
git switch test
npm run promote:test -- 0.54.2
```

This requires authenticated git and GitHub CLI access. The script verifies the clean/up-to-date branch, successful test build, live ancestry and version, creates a release commit, pushes it to the live desktop branch and fast-forwards Test to the same history. Equivalent GitHub connector operations can perform the same checked steps. Intervening live changes require merging into Test and a new passing build first. No force push is used.

The existing live CI builds and publishes the stable installers. It now creates the version tag at the actual release commit before electron-builder publishes (older release tags could point to the stale repository default branch). Watch CI through completion and verify release assets before reporting success. Live users receive the update on the app's existing launch / four-hour check and restart/install flow. Linux AppImages need an executable location; unsigned macOS live builds retain their existing manual-download limitation.

If a test build fails, its publish job does not run and the previous Test update feed remains available. A failed live promotion can be corrected with a newer version; do not overwrite a shipped version or reuse a release tag.

## Windows signing gate

Both release workflows stop if the existing Azure account/profile or tenant/client/secret credentials are missing. They retain the existing signing account, profile and regional endpoint. `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT` still defaults to the current East US endpoint when unset. No new secret is required.

`scripts/configure-windows-signing.js` enables `forceCodeSigning`, SHA-256 file and RFC 3161 timestamp digests, and updater signature verification. The existing public certificate subject is pinned in `scripts/windows-signing.js` for both release verification and the packaged updater; `AZURE_PUBLISHER_NAME` is no longer an optional switch that could disable updater publisher checking. Certificate thumbprints and intermediate CA names are deliberately not pinned because Azure rotates them. An intentional publisher identity change needs a reviewed code change and an updater migration plan.

After packaging, `scripts/verify-windows-signatures.js` runs on Windows. It requires embedded Authenticode signatures with Windows status `Valid`, the expected publisher, a timestamp, and successful `signtool verify /pa /all /v /tw`. Warnings fail too. The installer, portable executable, packaged application and private helpers are required; every EXE in the packaged app is checked. Test uses directory resource matchers so the builder signs its helpers as it copies them. Unsigned preflight files are discarded before the final build.

Each release includes `windows-signatures-<version>.json`: source commit, workflow run, per-file verification results and SHA-256 hashes. Publication rechecks the report against this workflow and the exact binaries, blockmap and update feed. Live packaging uses `--publish never`; the verified binaries and report upload first, followed by `latest.yml`. Test's Linux publication job requires the matching Windows report before any GitHub write. These reports are build evidence, not independent cryptographic attestations or a SmartScreen reputation guarantee.

For a tester warning, collect the screenshot, installer version/download URL, SHA-256 and `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` result for that exact file. Match it to the release report. Microsoft's reputation evaluation is separate from signature validity: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/smartscreen-reputation . Never promise that paying Azure or rebuilding a signed file instantly clears SmartScreen.
