# Beta readiness — status, baselines, and what still needs the owner

*2026-08-18. Written as the record of the Beta-track build (tasks #51–#53).
Facts below are live-probed, not assumed; the probe is
`core/scripts/chain-probe.js`, run from CI (`[chaincheck]` tag) because the
dev sandbox has no chain egress.*

## 1. The testnet KAI token — further along AND more broken than believed

The story until today was "the KAI contract is built but not deployed, and
the testnet RPC it would need does not publicly exist." **Both halves were
wrong**, live-probed 2026-08-18:

- **The Foundation testnet is ALIVE**: `https://testnet.koinosfoundation.org/jsonrpc`,
  chain id `EiAIKVvm6-V2qmsmUvPJy09vCCLbtn9lHFpwrJbcTIEWRQ==` (matches the
  pinned preset), head ~7.62M. Harbinger's public API
  (`harbinger-api.koinos.io`) is the dead one.
- **The KAI contract is DEPLOYED and functioning** at
  `149YvYQfj4MNaFecd7Rm3Z2rK6y2fkPYXz` (the operator's own address):
  `name=Koinos AI Token, symbol=KAI, total_supply=392521535199` —
  **3,925.21 KAI already minted** by past epoch claims.
- **But current settlement is failing quietly**: the last five epochs'
  roots are all MISSING on-chain, while the RPC answers and the operator
  holds ~100 tKOIN (balance probed on-chain — fuel is NOT the cause).

### Diagnosing the quiet failure — RESOLVED 2026-08-19 (production merge 3205141)

The claims endpoint went live with the owner's merge and answered the
question the same evening (Netcheck run 32302699733): settlement is
WORKING. 7 of the 8 most recent epochs for `1EXvuu…Mj6E` carry both
`settlement.rootTx` and `settlement.claim.tx` with `error: null` — roots
and claim mints are landing on the Foundation-testnet contract. The old
"missing roots" window predated the deploy; the chain-preset commit
(`8ca8cb8`, live defaults pointing at the working RPC) is the likely
cure. ONE epoch — `29786174`, closed during the deploy's restart window
(~20:29Z) — shows `settlement: null`; watch whether the resume logic
back-settles it, and if not it is one bounded 5.47-KAI casualty of the
restart, not a live fault. The Netcheck workflow now prints this claims
view every run (settlement stays observable without box access).

### Owner runbook — testnet KAI verification (10 minutes, on the box)

1. `grep -E "KAI_RPC_URL|KAI_CHAIN|KAI_CONTRACT" /opt/koinos/kai.env` —
   any KAI_RPC_URL there overrides the (working) default; if it points at
   harbinger or anything else, delete it or set it to
   `https://testnet.koinosfoundation.org/jsonrpc`.
2. `journalctl -u koinos | grep -E "settle-failed|settle-withheld" | tail`
   — the actual error text, tonight.
3. After the claims endpoint deploys, anyone can watch settlement heal:
   `curl "https://koinosai.com/scheduler/claims?address=1EXvuuW5HMrYRPdkraSi5Z4TBd4djyMj6E"`.

### Beta listing rehearsal (tradekoinos.com)

Probed live: `tradekoinos.com` answers — "Trade Koinos — the lossless
on-chain orderbook DEX." It trades MAINNET tokens, so the real listing
happens at mainnet launch; the contract already implements the full
KCS-4 surface a DEX needs (name/symbol/decimals/total_supply/
balance_of/transfer — probed on-chain). The Beta rehearsal is: deploy the
same wasm to mainnet behind the kill switch with claims disabled, list,
verify the pair renders and trades dust, THEN open claims at launch.
That deploy is `lib/chain.js` `KaiContract.deploy()` with `KAI_CHAIN=mainnet`
— one command on the box, owner-gated.

## 2. Anti-Sybil signal #3 — device fingerprint binding (SHADOW), shipped

- **App** (v0.28.5): the worker sends `Worker.fingerprint(hardware)` with
  registration — sha256 over platform/arch/CPU model+cores/rounded-GB
  RAM/sorted GPU names, 16 hex chars. Deterministic across boots and
  byte-level RAM wobble; changes when the hardware does; identical for
  every wallet on one device — which is the point. Coarse by construction;
  no serials, nothing personal.
- **Scheduler**: validates shape, stores it durably beside
  firstSeen/repPaidJobs, keeps the last good one when a registration omits
  or garbles it. Surfaces `fp` (8 chars) + `fpPeers` per worker in
  /network/status detail, and records `fingerprintGroups` (the
  {fingerprint: [addresses]} collision map) in every epoch summary beside
  reputationShadow.
- **NOT enforced anywhere.** The probe proves identical work still settles
  identically across a collision (equal work, equal pay). Enforcement
  waits for the owner's four gate decisions; recommendation stands:
  R_GATE 0.45, two-week shadow, fingerprint as an eligibility signal only.

Probes: kai `scripts/probe-fingerprint.js` (7 checks fail on the previous
build), kaiapp `core/test/fingerprint.test.js`.

## 3. Stress baseline — the scheduler is not the Beta bottleneck

`kai scripts/stress-swarm.js` boots a LOCAL scheduler (sqlite) and drives
the REAL protocol end to end (register + fingerprint, long-poll, chunks,
signed results, signed consumer chats). Never points at production.

Measured on a 4-core dev box, synthetic serve ≈600ms/job:

| run | throughput | p50 / p95 | spread | epoch close | status under load |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40 workers, 400 chats @ 25 | 36 chats/s | 643ms / 913ms | serving workers within 14–19 jobs each | 26ms | 2ms |
| 80 workers, 1600 chats @ 60 | 44 chats/s | 873ms / 3.7s | 80/80 served, top worker 49/1600 | 63ms over 1600 receipts | 7ms |

Also proven in-harness: every chat answered (0 drops), the per-IP free
ceiling pauses free usage with the friendly 402, every serving worker
holds a claim packet, and the fingerprint collision group lands in the
epoch record at scale. One design note the harness made legible: §51
perf-fed routing CONCENTRATES paid work on measured-fast workers when
serve time is zero — by design; fair seeding covers cold start; with
realistic serve times distribution is concurrency-bound and even.

Conclusion: at Beta scale (dozens of machines, tens of chats/second) the
scheduler and sqlite store have an order of magnitude of headroom on a
$6 VPS. The bottleneck will be model inference on providers' machines,
which is the thing Beta is supposed to measure.

## 4. Blocked on the owner

1. **Merge the kai dev branch into production A SECOND TIME.** The
   2026-08-19 merge (PR #2, `3205141`) landed at `475de9a` — BEFORE four
   commits that were pushed the same evening, so production is currently
   running the §20 splits with the treasury ACTIVE but WITHOUT the
   paid-only fix: free-tier emission is losing 10% to the treasury on
   chat receipts, which is exactly what the owner ruled against. Bounded
   today (eval receipts dominate and both sides are owner wallets) but
   wrong, and every epoch anchors it on-chain. Same compare page, same
   one click; the second merge ships:
   - `e3a5340` — §20 splits divide PAID value only (the money fix)
   - `4fb8dd2` — accounts: email/passkey/Google sign-in + device link +
     wallet attach (passkeys work immediately; email needs SMTP_HOST on
     the box — already set if waitlist mail works; Google needs
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)
   - `3a4be6e` — koinos-fast fits a 4GB Pi + per-worker `ram` in status
   - `2a9ae38` — anti-Sybil rollout order recorded beside the flags
   Expect ONE more scheduler restart on deploy.
2. ~~Settlement diagnosis~~ — RESOLVED, see §1: settlements are landing;
   only epoch `29786174` (deploy-restart window) is unsettled — check it
   once after the second merge.

### Decided 2026-08-19 (no longer blocking)

- **Anti-Sybil gates**: fingerprint binding enforces first; reputation
  gate stays at the shipped 0.45 default; two weeks of clean shadow from
  the production deploy of the fingerprint signal before anything arms.
  Recorded beside the flags in kai `deploy/app.env`.
- **§20 treasury**: activate, with the paid-only split semantics above.
- **Mainnet listing rehearsal** (§1): plan approved — deploy the same
  wasm to mainnet behind the kill switch with claims disabled, list on
  tradekoinos, verify dust trades, open claims at launch. Executes once
  testnet settlement is proven end-to-end.

## 5. Parked until beta — first-party big-model capacity (owner, 2026-08-22)

**Do not start this before beta. The owner parked it wanting more thought:
*"Lets put this on hold until we officially move into beta or right before
then."* This section exists so it surfaces THEN, rather than being
rediscovered.**

Direction is already set (`docs/cloud-gpu-design.md` §6): Koinos AI runs
big-model capacity itself as inventory, rather than teaching users to
integrate cloud hosting. The exploration behind it is finished and the
arithmetic is in that doc — a network worker renting a GPU loses money at
current rates, and the bootstrap pool cannot rescue it by design.

**Already shipped and NOT parked:** VRAM now counts in the advertise gate
(v0.41.2). That was a standing bug on consumer hardware — a 24 GB 4090 beside
16 GB of DDR4 was refused the classes it serves fastest — and it stands on its
own merits.

When this reopens, three things are settled and should not be re-litigated:

1. **Seed workers draw ZERO from the bootstrap pool.** The pool divides
   pro-rata across all honest receipts, so a first-party worker earning subsidy
   dilutes every volunteer. Build the exclusion BEFORE any pod reaches
   production — retrofitting means volunteers were already shorted.
2. **It must be visible on the stats page that we run them**, and seed pods
   must be excluded from the anti-Sybil shadow calibration.
3. **The catalog blocks it, not the hardware** — nothing above 32B exists to
   serve, and a 70B needs a real artifact URL + sha256.

Three things still need the owner and were NOT answered:

- Budget cap and trial length. An always-on 70B is order **$1,200-1,500/month**
  and recovers a minority of that even at full utilisation.
- Which 70B, and its price (the ladder suggests $2.00/$8.00 per 1M — a market
  call, not an engineering one).
- Whether scale-to-zero gets designed first. It is structural, not a
  nice-to-have: a worker that is not running is not in the roster, so nothing
  routes to it, so it never wakes. `PREFER_WINDOW_MS` + `/worker/warming` are
  the pieces. It is the difference between $1,400/month and paying for use.
