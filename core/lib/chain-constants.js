 * These are what we use when that call cannot be made.

/*
 * What a machine needs before it can run a Koinos node. Kept as DATA rather
 * than branching code so a hardware refusal is one edit when the facts change
 * — and so the date below can be shown to the user next to the verdict.
 *
 * arch: every one of the 11 node image tags pinned by koinos-node publishes a
 * single amd64/linux manifest with no arm64 variant, and its compose file
 * carries no `platform:` key, so `docker compose up` fails at image pull on an
 * ARM machine. That is an absence of software, not slowness — do not soften it
 * into "may be slow".
 *
 * Disk is two thresholds, not one: below minFreeGbToRun a node cannot run at
 * all; between the two it can run but only by syncing from genesis, which
 * takes days.
