 * Task #84 — a Koinos node reports itself without selling AI compute.
 *
 * Before this, the only thing that ever told koinosai.com about a block
 * producer was the earning Worker, on its own poll loop. So the dashboard
 * silently equated "this machine sells AI compute" with "this machine runs a
 * Koinos node", and an owner who turned Earning off watched their node
 * disappear from a page whose whole job is to tell them the node is fine.
 * Those are two separate decisions and this class reports the second one on
 * its own.
 *
 * It is deliberately a poor relation of the Worker: no token, no session, no
 * long poll. One signed POST on a timer, and nothing else. The scheduler
 * expires these rows on a TTL, so silence from a stopped node is self-
 * correcting rather than something that needs a goodbye to be delivered
 * reliably.
