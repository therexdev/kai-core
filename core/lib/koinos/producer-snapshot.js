 * This lived inside `earn.start()` until task #84, which is why a node that
 * was quietly producing blocks vanished from the owner's dashboard the moment
 * they turned Earning off. Running a Koinos node and selling AI compute are
 * two different decisions; only one of them was ever meant to control whether
 * the node reports itself. Both callers — the earning Worker and the
 * standalone reporter — now build the snapshot from this one function, so the
 * dashboard cannot describe the same node two different ways depending on
 * which switch happens to be on.
 *
 * `call` is the Koinos node service's request function; `appVersion` is
 * stamped into the snapshot so the website can tell an old client from a
 * chain RPC that would not answer.

   * Returns null when there is nothing to report: no node, a node that is
   * stopped or still syncing, or a node running without block production.
