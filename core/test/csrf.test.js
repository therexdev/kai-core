 * than a live bug. Node's undici fetch sends NO Origin and NO Sec-Fetch-Site
 * (so _sameSite passes it, correctly — it is a local program, not a page),
 * but it DOES send `sec-fetch-mode: cors` on every method. Measured on Node
 * v22: GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE all carry it.
 *
 * That header is a browser-fetch-metadata name sitting on a request that no
 * browser sent, which makes it exactly the kind of thing a later hardening
 * pass would reach for — "we check sec-fetch-site, why not sec-fetch-mode
 * too". Doing that would refuse every Node caller at once: the tester's own
 * 52-tool MCP server, Koinos Code, and anything anyone wrote against the
 * documented local API. Nothing would look wrong in review; the guard would
 * simply start rejecting the callers it exists to protect.
 *
 * So the contract is pinned here rather than left as a comment. Sec-Fetch-Site
 * and Origin are the ONLY headers that may decide this, because they are the
 * only two a browser sets that a local program does not.
