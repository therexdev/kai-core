 * it silently does nothing in the packaged app. This has now bitten the project
 * TWICE: once in the MCP "Your files" catalog entry (field report), and again
 * in the first Koinos Code workspace UI, where nine prompt() calls made every
 * button in the view dead on the desktop while the Chromium test passed
 * happily — because Playwright is a real browser and prompt() works there.
 *
 * That is why this test is STATIC rather than behavioural: no browser test can
 * catch it, because no browser reproduces the missing API. A grep is the only
 * thing that fails in the same environment where the bug is written.
 *
 * alert() and confirm() DO work in Electron and are allowed.

 * 1. "when you scroll down on the settings page it scrolls the whole sidebar

 *    scroll — it GROWS THE PAGE, so the window scrolls and takes the sidebar
 *    with it. #view-settings shipped without it.
 * 2. "make the toggle switch for koinos code justified to the right like the
 *    rest and separate it from the developer tools toggles with a line." That
 *    block carried class="switch-row" — a class this stylesheet has NEVER
 *    defined. It got no flex, no justification and no rule above it, and it
 *    had been that way since it was written; moving it into Settings just put
 *    it next to correct rows where the difference finally showed.
 *
 * Both are the same underlying failure: markup naming a class that does not
 * exist, or a view missing from a list it had to be added to by hand. So the
 * guard is mechanical — every class the markup uses must be defined somewhere.
