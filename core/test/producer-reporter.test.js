 * Task #84 — a Koinos node reports itself to the dashboard without selling AI
 * compute.
 *
 * The bug this closes is not a crash: it is a node that quietly vanished from
 * koinosai.com the moment its owner turned Earning off, because the only code
 * that ever reported a block producer lived inside the earning Worker. So the
 * tests here are mostly about WHEN a report is and is not sent, and about the
 * exact bytes on the wire — a report the scheduler rejects is the same
 * missing card, arrived by a longer route.
 *
 * Every tick is driven by hand. Nothing here waits on a timer.
