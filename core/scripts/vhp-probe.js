/*
 * Why one address reports two different VHP numbers.
 *
 * The desktop Node screen reads the wallet's VHP balance off chain. The block
 * producer prints "Producing with X VHP" from inside the node. On one field
 * machine those disagreed by 2.4x — same computer, same address — and a
 * dashboard that shows either number without knowing which is right is a
 * dashboard that lies about someone's money.
 *
 * This runs on a CI runner because the dev sandbox's proxy cannot reach
 * api.koinos.io. Read-only: balances and contract metadata, no keys, no
 * transactions. The address is a public mainnet address and is passed in.
 *
 * The specific suspicion it exists to test: KOIN and VHP have MIGRATED
 * contracts on mainnet before, and the app resolves their addresses at
 * runtime through get_contract_address while falling back to vendored
 * constants. If the resolved VHP contract is not the one the vendored
 * constant names, then "the balance" depends on which contract you ask —
 * and the app and the node could each be reading a different, real answer.
